# Deep Vision Vehicle Recognition

A computer vision project implemented with deep convolutional neural netwroks in order to classify images
from six different type of vehicles

## Instructions

You need to have python installed.

1. Open git bash and run $ git clone https://github.com/gagrinasg/vehicle-recognition.git or simply download the zip file and extract it.
2. You need to install the required libraries.Open a command line in the directory you cloned this repository and type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. You need to create a new API token. Log in to your kaggle account and go to your account.Scroll down to the API section and click "Create new API token". It will download a json file and you should move it to "C:\Users\username\\.kaggle".
4. You need to download the dataset from kaggle.In the command line of the directory type "kaggle competitions download -c duth-cv-2019-2020-hw-4"
5. Lastly you have to run jupyter server. In the command line type "jupyter notebook". It should redirect you to your default browser where you can run computer-vision.ipynb.
